## What is it?

A tool to parse XML output from nmap scans & extract/summarize key information.

## How does it work?

Using python and the xml.etree.ElementTree module.

## What's next?

More parsing options need to be added, such as summarizing services per host and so on. At the moment 3 parsing options are available.
