## What is it?

A tool to parse XML output from Nmap scans & extract/summarize key information.

## How does it work?

Using Python and the xml.etree.ElementTree module.

## What's next?

More parsing options need to be added, such as summarizing services and so on. At the moment 3 parsing options are available as shown in the image above.
