## What is it?

A tool to parse XML output from Nmap scans & extract/summarize key information. At the moment, 4 parsing options are available as shown in the image above.

## How does it work?

Using Python and the xml.etree.ElementTree module. There are no special dependencies other than Python 3.2 or above. Simply git clone & you're ready to go.

## What's next?

Let's colloborate! By all means, submit a pull request. There are so many more parsing options/features that can be added, your imagination is the limit.
